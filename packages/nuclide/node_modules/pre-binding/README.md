[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zertosh/pre-binding.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zertosh/pre-binding)

`pre-binding` is the [`node-pre-gyp`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp) binary module loader for use in modules that are distributed with pre-compiled binaries. `pre-binding` does not have the parts relating to compiling, only the parts relating to `node-pre-gyp`'s `find` method.

## Usage

Same as `node-pre-gyp`'s `find` method.
